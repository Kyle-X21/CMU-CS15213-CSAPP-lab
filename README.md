# CMU-CS15213-CSAPP-lab
## English edition:
Above all:If you want to contact me, my email is x.k.xie@qq.com .\
In it, there are some reports and codes I write to finish the CSAPP lab from CMU. I also try my best to provide explict explanaitions. Some codes are not released, and if you need them, you can contact me by email.\
I try my best to finish the lab by myself. It is hard to avoid the problems that I can't figure it out alone, and about these problems I reference the ideas of others.  \
I have finished all of the lab(in fact, the number is 8 because several labs on the official website have been replaced by new labs.).

如果你想要联系我，我的电子邮箱是x.k.xie@qq.com。\
本项目主要存放我完成CMU-CS15213-CSAPP的lab过程中的笔记和实现的代码。我也尽力提供清晰的解释。部分代码处于种种考虑没有公开，如果你需要它们可以通过电子邮件联系我。\
代码尽可能为独立编写，也难免有无法独自解决的问题而参考了其他人提供的思路。  \
我已经完成了所有8个实验。
